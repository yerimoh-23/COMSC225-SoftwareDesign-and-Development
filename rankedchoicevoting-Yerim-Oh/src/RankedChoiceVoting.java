/**
 * The ranked choice voting program implements the ranked choice voting 
 * algorithm.  This class reads election data from a file, constructs an 
 * election using that data, and reports the result of the election.
 * 
 * The input file should be formatted as follows:
 * 
 * 1. The file will begin with a line containing a number.  The number 
 * indicates how many candidates are in the election.
 * 2. This will be followed by a sequence of lines, where each line holds the 
 * name of a single candidate.  The order that the candidates are entered
 * is the same as the order that they appear on the ballots.
 * 3. Following that will be the ballots.  If there are n candidates, each 
 * ballot contains a permutation of the numbers from 1 to n.  The first number
 * on the ballot is the rank of the first candidate, the second number on the
 * ballot is the rank of the second candidate, etc.  A correctly formulated 
 * ballot line will have n integers, where n is the number of candidates.
 * Those integers will a permutation of the numbers 1 to n.  There can be
 * any number of ballots in the file.
